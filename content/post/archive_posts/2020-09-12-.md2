On 2 April, Matt Hancock set the ambitious goal for the United Kingdom, of reaching 100,000 COVID-19 tests per day by the end of the month. 

It has been widely documented that the claim to have met this deadline involved the dubious tactic of sending out tens of thousands of postal tests the day before the deadline, and counting them whether returned or not.

What has been much less remarked upon is that to any reasonable standard, this target seems to have never been met.

Promoting the plan in April, Downing Street tweeted that &#8220;100,000 people a day&#8221; would be tested by the end of the month. This was subtly different to Hancock&#8217;s promise of 100,000 tests. But one must be sympathetic to the PR
