The picture above, by [David Robinson][1] is a call-to-arms to get data out there which I remember every few days.

In that spirit, here are a couple of unlikely-to-be-published thoughts and data-points about transfection methodology in _Plasmodium_. Unless you&#8217;re a malaria biologist, you may want to stop here.

**What happens in a schizont transfection?**

Parasite transfections typically fall into three categories: transfection of red blood cells, from which parasites spontaneously take up DNA (how?!); transfection of ring stage parasites; and transfection of schizont stage parasites.

I have done most of my transfections on _P. knowlesi_, where schizont transfection is the typical protocol. The Blackman lab have now [popularised][2] schizont transfection as a highly efficient (by malaria standards) method for _P. falciparum_ too.

In the literature there is little discussion of a model of what actually happens to get DNA into malaria parasites. At most stages in the parasite lifecyle, exogenous DNA is separated from the parasite nucleus by four membranes.

One model for a schizont transfection is that upon electroporation the schizont simply falls apart &#8211; releasing merozoites with pores which take up DNA. There are some potential issues with this hypothesis, however. There is quite a bit of evidence to s
