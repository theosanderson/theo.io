There is no doubt in my mind that pre-publication peer-review does great damage to scientific progress. Its benefits would have to be vast to offset the

What are those benefits? Proponents argue that journals act as gate-keepers for the scientific knowledge-base, protecting us from a literature polluted with flawed science. One might think that journals would take this key responsibility pretty seriously, and there are doubtless countless hard-working editors who do.

Nevertheless, economic factors do not provide any significant incentive for publishing houses to do so. If such incentives existed the publishers would doubtless have found a means to automate the process of checking for the most obvious forms of scientific concept. If such incentives existed, publishers would undoubtedly flag with a large unmissable notice occasions where misconduct is [incontrovertible][1].

If you go to PubPeer and search for almost anything you will quickly find papers with questionable figures. In a large number of cases there is nothing on the journal site to indicate any concern about these data. Given the notional importance of this gate-keeper role, this seems odd.

I often wonder, are the journals simply unaware, do they not see these comments on PubPeer. Or are they willfully turning a blind eye to misconduct, since there is no economic advantage to uncovering it.

About x months ago I came across PubPeer discussion of this paper.
