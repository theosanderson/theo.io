I built the first version of the Covince lineage explorer and then led a small team of two that continued its development. The Covince lineage explorer was developed to power the [Sanger dashboard](//covid19.sanger.ac.uk/lineages/raw) and was probably the main tool for understanding dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 evolution in the UK. Screenshots featured in countless of [media](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15189367/shock-maps-rapid-spreadf-indian-variant-weeks/) [articles](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11328917/Dont-panic-vaccine-resistant-Covid-strain-ever.html). The Guardian and Sky News built their own pipelines that ingested data we provided in a machine-readable format.


We later repurposed Covince to display global SARS-CoV-2 data at [CovGlobe](//covglobe.org), and researchers at Queens University Belfast used our [open-source code](https://github.com/covince/) to [launch their own version](https://www.qub.ac.uk/News/Allnews/2022/ResourcelaunchedillustratingCOVID-19variantsacrossNorthernIreland.html).
