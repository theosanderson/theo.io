Prompted by a friend to explain my PhD in the style of [XKCD #1133](https://xkcd.com/1133/), I built the [Up-Goer Five Text Editor](https://splasho.com/upgoer5). It has been (and [continues to be](https://twitter.com/search?q=splasho.com%2Fupgoer5&src=typed_query&f=live)) widely used as a tool for thinking about science-communication, including with [conference sessions](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=up+goer+five&sp=CAI%253D).
