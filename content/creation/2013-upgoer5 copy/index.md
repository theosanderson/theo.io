The [Up-Goer Five text editor](https://www.splasho.com/upgoer5) is a simple tool I built inspired by [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1133/) to compel people to explain complex ideas in extremely simple language.

It:
- has been accessed hundreds of thousands of times
- spawned sub-projects like [Up-Goer Your PhD](https://upgoeryourphd.tumblr.com/)
- has been used to craft a number of novelty [conference sessions](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=up+goer+presentations)
- remains in [active use](https://twitter.com/search?q=splasho.com%2Fupgoer5&src=typed_query&f=live)
